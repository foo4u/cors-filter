# CORS Filter

Provides a [cross-origin resource sharing] [1] servlet filter compatible with Java 1.4+ JVMs.

This filter is intended to be simple and require no external runtime dependencies besides the
J2EE servlet API.  It is by no means the most feature rich CORS servlet filter implementation
but instead focuses on simplicity, minimal code and support for the legacy JDK 1.4.
